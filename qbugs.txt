Hi,

I have a problem... my DSP program is getting too big so it overwrites
X:memory... so, I changed some stuff and moved the X:memory:

First it was:
	ORG X:$0
Now it is:
	ORG X:$40

but I get alot of errors, strange errors like labels missing in the
program!? What has program labels got to do with X:mem!? hmm

I need more P:memory and I thought move the X ORG would help.
Maybe you know more about this?

>>> I dunno. Tested this a bit, but I need the source to figure it out.

Oki, now I get no errors when asembling in Qasm but it refuese to work...
it just hangs.
Anyway, here are 3 more "bugs"

tmi	x0,b	(not sure but I think this was it)

>>> Tested and it works correctly. No bug here.

Labels can be double:

label:	move	whatever
label:	move	whatever
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ no errors when compiling...

>>> Ayee! You're right! I fixed it now. Tested it with some selfmade sources
>>> and EXA's amongst others. Seems to work ok. Please tell me if it still
>>> doesn't work as it should.

Labels cannot contain the register symbols:

Label_R0

>>> Tested this and it seems "Label_R0" can exist, while "R0_Label" can't!
>>> I fixed it, but still there could be some bugs concerning this. Please
>>> let me know if it freaks out again!

Ok, this is just small bugs and I dont care if you fix them, just thought
I let you know... :)

Hi, Im finally trying to get my asources to work in Qasm.. :)
I found something I think is a bug, I think this is all you need to know:

	rep	#label2-label1
	move	whatever

	ORG	X:0
label1	ds	1
lebel2

>>> Mmmhhh.. You seem to have used a "lEbel2" instead of a "lAbel2". Did this
>>> perhaps cause an error? I'll get on it right now to see...
>>> OH NO! You're right again! It seems you are forced to use "<" in front of
>>> the number since rep can only use short immediate-data!!
>>> I've now corrected this! Works fine now! =)

>>> Hope you like the new fixed version. Please STay in touch to report any
>>> new bugs to me. Work on new features will start soon.
