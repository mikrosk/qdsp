Hi ppl,

I decided to fix some bugs I found in last (0.13b) release. I did it by 
myself, why to bore Earx with another buglist ;-)

For more info about improvements -> history.txt

Maybe would be some words about parameters useful:

Basic options (n/l/w) are clear I hope. All parameters you can type 
with/out spaces or "-". Only thing you should keep in mind is the fact you 
have to give one space between options and source filename!

bad syntax:  qdsp_asm.ttp -n -l -w030KICKER.ASM
good syntax: qdsp_asm.ttp n l-woMYFILE 030KICKER.ASM

That means if you're user of TOS, your installed .ttp aplication has to 
respect this! ("Arguments: lw " for example)

OK, that's all, I repeat this is only unofficial 'hack' version, Earx is 
of course official and stable developer of QDSP..
